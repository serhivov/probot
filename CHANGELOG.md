# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Callbacks passed to `robot.on` used to take two argumentsâ€”`event` and `context`. The second was pretty much just a fancy version of the first, and you really need the second to do anything useful, so the first argument has been dropped. (Technically, the second is passed as both arguments for now to preserve backward compatibility, but this won't be the case forever, so go update your plugins).

    Before:

    ```js
    robot.on('issues.opened', async (event, context) => {
      log('Event and context? What is the difference?', events, context);
    });
    ```

    After:

    ```js
    robot.on('issues.opened', async context => {
      log('Sweet, just one arg', context, context.payload);
    });
    ```

## v0.6.0 (2017-06-09)

Breaking Changes:

- Update to [node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github) v9, which namespaces all responses with a `data` attribute. (https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github/pull/505). This is likely to be a breaking change for all plugins.

    Before:

    ```js
    const data = await github.search.issues(params);
    data.items.forEach(item => doTheThing(issue));
    ```

    After:

    ```js
    const res = await github.search.issues(params);
    res.data.items.forEach(item => doTheThing(issue));
    ```

- "GitHub Integrations" were renamed to "GitHub Apps". The `INTEGRATION_ID` environment variable has been deprecated. Use `APP_ID` instead. ([#154](https://github.com/probot/probot/pull/154))

Enhancements:

- Errors thrown in handlers from plugins were being silently ignored. That's not cool. Now, they're being caught and logged.
 ([#152](https://github.com/probot/probot/pull/152))
